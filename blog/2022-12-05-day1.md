What I learned today:
    - .NET is a Classical Strongly-Typed Object Oriented Programming Language
    - .NET uses PascalCase
    - A solution can hold multiple projects. When we compile a project, it becomes an assembly

What do you remember that you *think* is important?
    - What is the CLR? Common Language Runtime
    - What is IL code? Intermediate Code - it compiles at run time, gets converted to bytecode during execution of a virtual machine. Used for automatic generation of compiled code
    - What is the entry point for a .net application? Main() method!
    - What is ".Net Core" and why was it important? Open source developer framework, used in Windows, Linux, and MacOS
    - Anything else? VS shortcut: CTRL + F5 (save all open files, compiles and starts w/o debugging)

What I need to learn more about?
    - Getting used to syntax differences b/t C# and Java - mainly curly braces {}!
    - What is an "HTTP API"???

```csharp
some code (3 backticks before and after to denote)
```
