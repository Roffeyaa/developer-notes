Outline for the day:
    
    Evolving Code - Loose Coupling
        Controlling Chaos
        
    TDD Exercise

    Back to C# Syntax
        More on Types
            Generics
            Collections
            Nullable Value Types and Reference Types
            Contructors
            Overloading and overriding methods
            
        Functional Programming in C#
            Delegates
	

	Enumerated constants: data type which makes values into integers
		public enum BankAccountType { Standard, Gold }
			Standard is 0, Gold is 1
			First option is default
			
	Programmer Wisdom:
		- Make invalid states IMPOSSIBLE
		- Write your code in such a way that after it ships, it doesn't have to be modified again.
			ยง Why? WE ARE SOOOO much more likely to introduce bugs into code when we are making changes.
			ยง AKA "Open/Closed" principle: code should be open to extension but closed for modification
		- Objects cannot change their type
		- Inheritance is often called for in frameworks or UI libraries
		- "Prefer Composition over Inheritance" - repeat this mantra 100X
		

	Definitions:
		- State = the value of all the data in a module (class, etc.) at a point in time.
		- "application" - you are an "Application Developer" applying stuff to solve real problems
		- Code for other developers to use:
			ยง Libraries - "code your code uses"
			ยง Framework - "code that uses your code" - there are often classes provided that you extend
			
	Overriding methods: add virtual keyword
	
	"New is Glue" - making a "NEW" instance of something is tightly coupling
	
	Feedback loops in software development
		Inner loop
			- Everything that you do on your machine while you write code
			- This means we've intentionally set up our environment and choose the tools that are going to give us the most amount of "feedback" about how our work is going as quickly as possible
		
		Outer loop
			- Everything that happens after we push our code to the repository
